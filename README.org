* Solving Tower of Hanoi
** The purpose of this repository
   This repository contains model, view and controller classes for
   solving Tower of Hanoi.

** Installation in IDEA
   To install the application in IDEA, do the following:
   1. Clone the repository.
   2. Right click on class =TOHApp=.
   3. Select =Run TOHApp.main()=
   You are now able to make changes to the project and run it again.

** Alternative installation method
   1. Clone repository.
   2. Run =ant= default target (builds and runs the application).

** Programming your solution
   Class =TOHApp= contains method
   #+begin_src java :exports code
     static void solve (TowerOfHanoi toh, int numDiscs, Peg from, Peg to)
   #+end_src
   which you need to modify to solve the problems. The =main()= of
   this class calls method =solve()= with correct parameters for
   solving the problem, that is, moving all discs from rod A to rod C.

   The version of =solve()= in this repository is a feeble attempt to
   solve this problem, and you need to replace it with your own
   version. Still, the feeble version demonstrates the only external
   methods you need to use:
   - =class TowerOfHanoi= contains method
     #+begin_src java :exports code
       move (Peg from, Peg to)
     #+end_src
     which moves top disc of rod =from= to rod =to=. This may throw an
     exception if the move breaks the rules of Tower of Hanoi, but
     this exception is caught by the program. Possible exceptions are
     printed into console.
